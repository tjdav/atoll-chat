## MIG-FIX — Remove Redundant requires_reregistration Migration
- **ID:** MIG-FIX
- **Date:** 2026-10-02
- **Status:** Complete.
- **Spec sections affected:** §5.8
- **Question asked:** How to resolve the migration conflict where `requires_reregistration` column was added twice during fresh database migration?
- **Answer found:** Removed redundant `0025_requires_reregistration.sql` migration file. The `requires_reregistration` column is already defined in `0020_users_oprf_identity.sql`. Database migrations 0001 through 0024 now run sequentially without conflict on a clean database.
